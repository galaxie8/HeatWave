//I helped to develop this as a part of a team at PennApps XII hackathon. This hack uses an arduino to read sensor outputs from both a force and thermal sensor. The driver turns on the thermal sensor through a push button addition to the driver's right arm rest. This would be ideal for pet or child caregivers who are walking away from their vehicles temporarily, and are unable to bring their dependent due to logistical complications. It would allow for them to get phone notifications, through an android app. which feeds them with automatic real time temperature alerts, prompting caregivers to rescue their endangered dependent. For a child, this systems becomes independent, without the need for a push button prompt. Instead, the Arduino and app become activated through the application of an appropriate weight applied to a force sensor, which is located in a special padded car seat cushion.
